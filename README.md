# Sameer Sharma

Enterprise Platform Architect with a focus on designing, securing, and automating large-scale environments.

## What I work on
- **Enterprise platforms**: Citrix, Azure, Windows 365
- **Identity & access**: Entra ID, Intune, conditional access, authentication flows
- **Automation & IaC**: PowerShell, Terraform, Ansible, REST APIs
- **Architecture themes**: Resiliency, Scalability, Fault isolation, Service continuity

My work is centered around **real-world enterprise constraints**: global scale, regulatory boundaries, operational simplicity, and predictable user experience.

## Current focus areas
- Automating identity- and policy-driven platform behavior
- Integrating Citrix and Microsoft cloud services in hybrid and multi-region designs
- Reducing operational risk through standardization and automation
- Exploring policy-driven placement and resiliency patterns for cloud workloads

## Repositories
Most repositories here are:
- Practical (built from real deployments)
- Opinionated (trade-offs explained, not hidden)
- Designed to be reusable and auditable

Expect a mix of:
- PowerShell tooling
- Terraform modules
- Architecture notes and experiments

## Philosophy
- Architecture before tooling
- Clarity over cleverness
- Automation as a control mechanism, not just convenience
- Designs should explain themselves six months later
